        <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
        <p>Hello there ! This is my first project in PHP and it is a side project where the sublime aim behind this project is 
        trying to implement every single particle of my knowledge into this website so that it makes remembring concepts easy and 
        grasping the ideas behind every functionality much more better than just call a function and let it does everything.</p>
        <p>I'm pretty sure that you'll disagree with me on the following points, but I have my reasons and I'm ready to listen with 
        open mind to you. I don't like frameworks since i began this whole field, and i didn't know why before, but now I still don't like
        frameworks for couple of reasons. Just think of that, which is better for you, create a feature from scratch and know every single detail
        about it or use a framework to do it ? by answering this question you'll determine which kind of person you are , either you like to make
        things done very quickly or you have a deadline or your boss told you to give him the solution as fast as you can. Unfortunately, I'm not this kind of persons,
        I like adventures, and I like to be stuck with errors for long time so I learn a lot of stuff by just finding out a soluition to a specific problem.
        This time when i'm writing this lines I don't have any experience with big companies or all the benefits of frameworks but at least
        I know a lot of drawbacks of using frameworks and the biggest problem is to be limited to the framework you're using.
        Anyway, it's a long talk about this subject, but kleep in mind that this project (at least) is frameworkless.</p>
        <p>The last hint that i like to talk about is that i like the websites where the design is very basic, but behind the scenes very complicated and optimized code running !</p>

        <h3>General points of the project</h3>
        <p>Like any other e-commerce website, the user redirected to the website or access it through a web engine (e.g. google, bing).
        The website has a title (temporary), a header that contains the logo, search section, and some navigation buttons. underneath that, 
        there's the featured product (that will be choosen by an admin in the admin panel), and some informations about the service, and of course our best seller, and a section for getting
        letters from us, and footer [Very basic layout with simple things]</p>
        <p>When the user search for a product, we redirect the user to a result page where he'll find the results. But all of that cannot be done if we don't have product stored 
        somewhere; in database of caurse lol. Now this is the most important part of the project, and let's dive into it.</p>
        <h5>Admin Panel - The other side of the website</h5>

        <p>Admin panel is like a special CMS where admins of website can do stuff, regular users can't like adding new products or managing users and manage stock .. etc.
        The first page of admin panel is actually a dashboard where statistics of products and data about best seller products will be organized in a proper layout that allows 
        admins to see everything.
        Admin of course needs to add categories and suppliers of products, and payment methods and products .. etc. Every entity needs some kind of management so we can add, edit and delete entities, and all of 
        that of course happens behind the scenes. </p>
