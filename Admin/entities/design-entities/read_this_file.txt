I created this folder to encapsulate all the entities that are commun to all web pages including inputs, 
basically this idea came to me when i got a lot of inputs in supplier add page and get the code harder to read 
for that reason i decided to create some separate entities so i can use them later without writing the code from scratch

Hint: Notice that some entities require some css files to be included, otherwise they don't work
