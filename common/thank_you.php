        <p class="thank">Hi Nancy,

From all of us at The Crooked Bookstore, welcome to our family! Thank you so much for your purchase of And Then There Were None. It’s a classic, and we’re sure you’ll love it!

We’re a small, carefully curated bookshop, and we stand by all of our titles. That means if you don’t like the book, you can trade it for any other book in our store. Just send your reply to this email and we’ll get everything sorted out.

Thank you again for choosing The Crooked Bookstore, we hope to hear from you again soon!

Your friend,

Zachary</p>
